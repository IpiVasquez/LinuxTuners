Hey! I'm a guy who likes to install Linux distributions over and over on my
personal computers. Over time, I realized I pretty much always follow the same
procedure to install the different Linux utilities I use on fresh installs.

This projects is structured by branches, where each branch is meant to help to
set up certain Linux distribution I've use. So, each branch works for the
distribution specified.
